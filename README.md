* The game shuffles the cards randomly;
* The player starts the game. In effects starts a move counter and timer;
* The player can uncover only two cards at the same time;
* Covering and uncovering is animated;
* Matched cards gives a flash effect and stays uncovered;
* When the player matches all 8 pairs of cards, the timer stops and the game shows the player's result: move's number, star rating and time of the game;
* Star rating coresspondes with number of moves in the following way:
	* less than 14 moves, gives a three stars,
	* from 14 to 15 moves - gives a two stars,
	* from 16 to 17 moves - gives a one star,
	* there is no stars above 17 moves.
